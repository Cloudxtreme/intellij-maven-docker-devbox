IntelliJ and Maven Java Development Environment in a Docker Container
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This Docker image is based off the official library java openjdk image which runs Debian.  I have extended it to contain an IntelliJ IDEA installation and Maven.  These will then run under a `dev` user.
